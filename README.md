# 🌰 Nutology: The Entropy of the Last Good Nut

Nutology is a smart NFT protocol that introduces **behavioral entropy** into the NFT ecosystem. Each NFT — or “nut” — has a personality and evolves based on how it's treated. Neglect your nut or transfer it too often, and it starts to decay. Lost value is redistributed to other holders. Care for your nut, and it thrives.

At the very end, only **one nut will survive** — the **last good nut** — and it will inherit all the value in the system.

## 🧠 Problem

NFTs today are static, emotionless, and driven by speculation. There's no reason to build a relationship with them — and no gameplay or consequences.

---

## 💡 Solution

Nutology introduces NFTs with:
- **Personality** and emotion
- **On-chain entropy** that reacts to behavior
- **Value decay and redistribution**
- **Real-world NFC integration (coming soon)**
